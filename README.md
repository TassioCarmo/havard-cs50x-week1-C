When we evaluate the quality of our code, we might consider the following aspects:
<ul>
<li> correctness, or whether our code solves our problem correctly</li>
<li> Design</strong>, or how well-written our code is, based on how efficient and readable it is
<li> <strong>Style</strong>, or how well-formatted our code is visually</li>
</ul>
