<h1>Introduction to the C language </h1>
<h1>What did i learn?</h1>

When we evaluate the quality of our code, we might consider the following aspects:
<ul>
<li> <strong>Correctness</strong>, or whether our code solves our problem correctly</li>
<li> <strong>Design</strong>, or how well-written our code is, based on how efficient and readable it is
<li> <strong>Style</strong>, or how well-formatted our code is visually</li>
</ul>
<p>The most important here is not only your code to be correct but it must be <strong>well-designed</strong> to be easier to read months from now by you or someone else or some maintenance</p>

<h2>IDEs, compilers, interfaces</h2>

A IDEs or integrated development environments, include features for us to write, translate, and run our code.


Source code something written in a programming language
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}

```

Machine code

```
10010000 11101110 10101010 10001000
```
 A compiler is a program that can convert one language to another, such as source code to machine code:
